It can enable commands to be accessible in the frontend of the application.

If the scope is defined it can be used to fine grain control the access of individual or multiple commands.

**Object Properties**:

* identifier (required)
* platforms
* scope
* version

### [commands](#commands)

Allowed or denied commands when using this permission.

Default

```

{

"allow": [],

"deny": []

}

```

### [description](#description)

### [Scopes](#scopes)

An argument for fine grained behavior control of Tauri commands.

It can be of any serde serializable type and is used to allow or prevent certain actions inside a Tauri command.

"deny": [{ "path": "$HOME/secret.txt" }]

}

```
