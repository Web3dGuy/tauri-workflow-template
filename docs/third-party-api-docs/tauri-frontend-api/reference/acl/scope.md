# Scope

An argument for fine grained behavior control of Tauri commands.

It can be of any serde serializable type and is used to allow or prevent certain actions inside a Tauri command.
The configured scope is passed to the command and will be enforced by the command implementation.

### [Example](#example)

```

{

"allow": [{ "path": "$HOME/**" }],

"deny": [{ "path": "$HOME/secret.txt" }]

}

```

**Object Properties**:

* allow
* deny

### [allow](#allow)

[`Value`](#value)[] | `null`

Data that defines what is allowed by the scope.

### [deny](#deny)

[`Value`](#value)[] | `null`

Data that defines what is denied by the scope. This should be prioritized by validation logic.
