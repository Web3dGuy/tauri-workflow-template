Expand description

Include a [`Context`](struct.Context.html.md "struct tauri::Context") that was generated by [`tauri-build`](https://docs.rs/tauri-build) inside your build script.

You should either use [`tauri-build`](https://docs.rs/tauri-build) and this macro to include the compile time generated code,
or [`generate_context!`](macro.generate_context.html.md "macro tauri::generate_context"). Do not use both at the same time, as they generate the same code and
will cause excess computations that will be discarded.
